Malaria Detection system is a solution for malaria infected cell detection. On the web side, we utilize a full stack service. Technologies being used are react (javascript) on the front end and flask(python) on the back end. In our backend, we serve our machine learning model on IBM cloud and connect to it using an IBM Watson Machine Learning.
